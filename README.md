# 🌟 OpenCV: The Eyes of Artificial Intelligence 👁️🚀

## 👋 What is OpenCV?

**OpenCV** (**Open Source Computer Vision Library**) is an open-source toolkit for computer vision, image processing, and machine learning.  
It provides **over 2,500 optimized algorithms** that can detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, stitch images together, and much more.

Originally developed by **Intel** in 1999, it has grown into a **cross-platform powerhouse** used in:
- 📱 **Mobile apps** (e.g., AR filters, barcode scanners)
- 🏭 **Industrial automation** (e.g., defect detection, robotics)
- 🩺 **Medical imaging** (e.g., tumor detection, x-ray analysis)
- 🛻 **Autonomous vehicles** (e.g., lane detection, pedestrian tracking)

## 🧱 Core Features & Modules

### 1️⃣ **Image Processing**
- Image I/O (read/write images in multiple formats)
- Color space conversions (BGR ↔ RGB ↔ HSV ↔ Grayscale)
- Geometric transformations (resize, rotate, crop, affine, perspective)
- Histogram equalization for contrast enhancement
- Filtering: blur, Gaussian, median, bilateral
- Edge detection (Canny, Sobel, Laplacian)

### 2️⃣ **Video Analysis**
- Accessing webcam and video streams
- Background subtraction & motion tracking
- Frame differencing and optical flow

### 3️⃣ **Object Detection**
- Haar cascades for face/eye/car detection
- Deep learning-based detection (YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN)
- Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to refine detections

### 4️⃣ **Feature Detection & Matching**
- Keypoint detection (SIFT, SURF, ORB, AKAZE)
- Matching algorithms (Brute-Force, FLANN)
- Image stitching & panorama creation

### 5️⃣ **Camera Calibration**
- Correcting lens distortions
- Estimating 3D coordinates from 2D projections

### 6️⃣ **Machine Learning Integration**
- Built-in ML algorithms (SVM, kNN, Decision Trees)
- Integration with TensorFlow/PyTorch models via `dnn` module
- Support for ONNX models

### 7️⃣ **3D Vision**
- Stereo vision and depth map generation
- Structure from motion (SfM)
